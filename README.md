# Password Strength Checker and Generator

A simple Python script that checks the strength of a given password and generates a strong password.
- Compatible with Windows only.


## Usage

The script will prompt you to enter a password. Once you enter a password, the script will check its strength and print out the result. You will then be prompted to generate a strong password. If you choose to generate a password, it will be copied to your clipboard.

## Features

- Checks the strength of a given password.
- Generates a strong password.
- Copies the generated password to clipboard.

### Note

A safer method would be to use the operating system library to interact with the clipboard that is specific to your operating system and the programming language you are using.
